## Getting Started

**Step 1. Install package** - Easiest way to get started is to install UniformCSS using npm, this will get you the latest build.

```sh
npm install @uniformcss/uniformcss
```

**Step 2. Add Uniform** - Simply drag-and-drop the uniform folder to your sass directory and add this one liner to your stylesheet.

```scss
@use "uniform" as *;
```

**Step 3. Build everything** - Compile your sass and just like that, you now have access to all the utility classes. It's that simple.

```html
<div class="flex w-6 h-6 mx-auto radius-md bg-black color-white">
  ...
</div>
```
